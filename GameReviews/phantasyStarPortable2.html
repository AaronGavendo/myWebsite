      <h1>Phantasy Star Portable 2 Review</h1>
      <p><b>June 26th 2015</b></p>
      <p>Phantasy Star Portable 2 is a 2009 (2010 in N.A.) JRPG for the Playstation Portable. Despite a few difficulties and problems the game is fun and the story was great. It was good  for my first PSP game. The plot revolves around mercenaries doing jobs in space for hire, but soon evolves into a universe saving quest. </p>
      <p><b>Gameplay:</b> There is a wide variety of weapons in the game including swords, spears, daggers, pistols, machine guns, rifles and more. You can equip up to 5 different weapons at a time and switch between them where appropriate with ease. The levels are fought with other NPC's and contain checkpoints and a boss battle at the end. In addition to Story Missions there are Open Missions, Tactical Missions and Trade Missions. These are side missions you can use to grind up when you need. One fun feature of the game involves contests played out in the Open Missions. Open Missions are regular levels with monsters and usually a boss at the end. In the challenges clients will ask you to do these in a time limit, or kill a certain number of a type of monster.  </p>
      <p><b>Difficulty:</b> While playing this game I found that the levels were not terribly hard however the boss battles were quite difficult. There was always the opportunity to grind up levels and return straight to the boss battle without playing through the entire level again. For me, I found that the second boss took so long to beat that by the time I had defeated it I was able to sore through the next few levels as I had grinded up so many levels to get past it. </p>
      <p>In the Open Missions, there are four levels of difficulty you can select (C, B, A, S). The difficulty level between the lowest level (C) and the second lowest level (B) was staggering. For example, in one mission a C level has enemies at level 11 and the B has level 50's and the C at 100's. The result of this is you won't be able to advance to the next difficulty until towards the end of the game. I have never actually got to beat a mission on level A even once defeating the final boss. These higher level Open Missions are significantly harder than even the final boss. I find this quite redundant, but if you're up for a challenge it might be good for you. </p>
      <p><b>Design/Art/Characters:</b> The scenery in Phantasy Star Portable 2 is pretty good considering it is on portable hardware. The levels always seem fresh and considering there are dozens of side missions I'm surprised they were able to give them all their own personality. </p>
      <p>The main characters of the game were all enjoyable and by the end of the story I felt I actually cared about what happened to them which in my opinion is the best trait of good character writing.</p>
      <p><b>Music:</b> I actually ended up buying this games soundtrack which can tell you how great it is. The mission songs are repetitive at times, but the story line music is quite relaxing and enforces the kindness of the characters. The intro and credits songs are the only with lyrics and they are two of my favourites. </p>
      <p><b>Finally:</b> Phantasy Star Portable 2 is a great game with lots of fun game play that stays enjoyable throughout. I recommend it for any RPG fan who is up for a medium challenge. </p>
