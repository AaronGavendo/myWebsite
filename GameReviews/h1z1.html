      <h1>H1Z1 Review</h1>
      <p><b>July 28th 2015</b></p>
      <p>H1Z1 is a sandbox zombie survival MMO game set after worlds end. Players are placed in a world with little more than the clothes on their back and forced to scavenge and survive in a post-apocalyptic world where everything seems to want to kill you. </p>
      <p>Keep in mind at the time of this review the game is in its early access alpha phase so expect more to come and things to change. </p>
      <p><b>Gameplay: </b>Players are placed into an online world set after a zombie outbreak. The only incentive for the player is to survive, but it is not as easy as you would think. As soon as you start the game, you will need to worry about zombies, animals and other real people playing on the server. You will then need to search for supplies that will help you survive.</p>
      <p>You will need look in the forest for items such as berries, wood and animal products or go into towns/houses for manufactured items such as guns, ammo and cars. These items will help you to survive if you know what you're doing.</p>
      <p>There is also the option to take simple items and craft them into better ones. Such as taking wood and fabric and creating a bow and arrow. If players are skilled enough they can build entire forts, build fires or build land mines. The reverse to this can be done, such and taking a wooden box and breaking it down for wood planks and nails. </p>
      <p>The player will also need to constantly search for food or find a way to produce it (hunt and cook). The player has a meter than measures their hunger, energy, hydration and other things (this feature is constantly being tweaked).</p>
      <p>The game continues until the player logs out. The game will force they playing to sit still for a few seconds before logging out. This ensures they don't leave at the sight of danger to save their items. Once the player is logged out they can return to the same spot with all their items later on. If they player dies, they lose all of their items unless they can find the spot they died after respawning and if they are not stolen or the time limit expires.</p>
      <p><b>Enemies: </b>The main threat to you are not the zombies or nature, but rather other players. Sure you can make friends with them and help each other survive, but they'll probably just try to kill you to steal your supplies or for no reason at all. This can be quite frustrating as upon dying you lose everything you gathered previously, but it is all part of the game and you might just make a friend in the other players.</p>
      <p>In addition to players trying to kill you there are zombies. Zombies are usually found in towns but can be anywhere. They can be easily killed with three arrows to the body or one to the head. I would suggest using arrows to kill them so you can save your ammo and that they can be killed easily before they reach you. After you kill a zombie you will occasionally get a loot bag which may or may not contain anything interesting. If a group of zombies gang up on you they can be quite harmful. If you find yourself bleeding, kill off the zombies and strap on some bandages. </p>
      <p>There are animals such as wolves and bears that can harm you as well. These can be seen before they get to close to you and avoided. Wolves can be killed with most weapons but bears are difficult and they are very hard to outrun.</p>
      <p><b>Weapons: </b>There are several weapons you can find in H1Z1, new weapons are being added all the time so I won't get too specific. When you start the game it would be good to craft a bow and arrow and it is easy and essential for survival. From here you can search the towns, buildings and vehicles for weapons. It would be good to get a melee weapon like a axe or machete for close combat. Melee weapons are easy to find, unlike guns. In H1Z1 there are pistols, shotguns and rifles. There are scoped hunting rifles as well as more advanced weapons like the AR-15 and AK-47. The guns are not as hard to find as is the ammunition. These are rare with only one or two round being found at once. A recent update has actually made ammo more plentiful and guns harder to find. As of now it is unclear of what directions the developers are going to go with this. As weapons are used they will need to be repaired, weapon repair kits can be found through the game area, usually in vehicles. </p>
      <p><b>World: </b>The game world is quite big and not flat, so expect it to take a long time to travel across. The game world is surrounded by a poison gas that creates a sandbox environment, similar to how Grand Theft Auto games are on islands. The game has mountains, lakes, rivers forests, towns and any man made structure you would see in the American countryside. The player is provided with a map and compass to tell the approximately where they are, but it can get confusing. There are drivable vehicles in the game but they are hard to come by and usually require repairs and fuel which are hard to get your hands on.  Visually the world is not that stunning but you should enjoy exploring it. </p>
      <p><b>Atmosphere: </b>The game gives off a very creepy atmosphere and while playing it I legitimately felt scared. It's been a while since a game or even a movie has made me feel that way. The game has eerie music and sound effects as well as classic animal sounds in the distance. The zombies are scary at night no matter how used to killing them you are. The biggest shocks come when another player pops up out of nowhere and blows your head off with a shotgun.</p>
      <p><b>Battle Royal: </b>In addition to the main game, there is a side game known as Battle Royal. In this game mode the user is dropped into the word via parachute along with up to 150 other players. You must then fight each other until there is one person left, while poison gas moves in on the map and makes the playing area smaller. This game mode has no zombies or animals and it has abundant supplies of weapons and ammo in most structures. </p>
      <p>In my opinion this style of game play is much better than the rest of the game. I find working towards a victory to keep the game fresh after you get tired of basic survival. </p>
      <p><b>Needed Improvements: </b>H1Z1 is a game that is constantly getting updates and I've already found that a few of my concerns have been worked out. The suggestions I list below may have already been improved upon by the time you read this.</p>
      <p>I find that the items that the defeated zombies carry are not very usefully and unpractical. It seems unrewarding to kill zombies most of the time as they only drop items about 35% of the time and these items are rarely helpful. Also it would make more sense for a zombie to have weapons or ammo but they just have items that would be unlikely for a person trying but unable to survive a zombie apocalypse to have. </p>
      <p>Ammo in the game is hard to find. That is ok, because it makes the game challenging. But I don't understand why you only find one or two cartridges at a time. It would be more realistic to find a box or magazines worth of ammo at a time, not just a few cartridges. </p>
      <p>The Battle Royal game mode needs a spectator mode for the surviving players after they are killed. It would be great to see your friends or the person that defeated you play on and see how far they can get in the game. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion: </b>H1Z1 is a great and creative game that is frequently getting better with updates and can be purchased affordably from Steam. The Battle Royal mode is probably better than the main game, but the actual game is still amazing. I suggest any fan of shooting, zombies or online multiplayer games give this a try. </p>
