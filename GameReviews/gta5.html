      <h1>Grand Theft Auto 5 Review</h1>
      <p><b>June 30th 2015</b></p>
      <p>I waited over a year and a half for Grand Theft Auto 5 to finally come to the personal computer. I could have got it for the 7th generation consoles back in 2013 but in my opinion keyboard and mouse can't be beat. I went to the game store to buy my physical copy the first day it was out. I know it's old fashion to do that but a collector can appreciate the packaging. Also, 65GB of game data would put quite a strain on my household's monthly downloading limit. After installing all seven discs I actually had to jump through hoops to get the game to start working, it was quite frustrating but Rockstar was quick to patch it up after I found my workaround. The first few days of playing the game were quite shaky with glitches and control issues. However, after another patch the game worked fine and I have not had any trouble with it since. </p>
      <p><b>Gameplay:</b> GTA 5 takes place in the fictional state of San Andreas and like most GTA games, GTA 5 makes the player complete missions to beat the game with plenty of side missions and free roaming that might make the story take back seat. Unlike the other games, you can switch between three characters. Each characters has their own special ability such as rage mode or slow motion.  The layout of the missions can be customized by the player to a greater extent than ever before. The game makes choosing your weapons in battle ease and lets you slow down the game while doing so. </p>
      <p><b>Map/Atmosphere/Art:</b> The map in GTA 5 is massive. From the city, to the mountains, from the canyons to the desert the game looks fabulous. Not since GTA San Andreas have I started a game and been so eager to just explore. Unlike GTA 4, this games map has more variety than just urban areas. The country side is great to roam and opens more possibilities for missions. Even the city (based off of Los Angeles) has a better atmosphere due to LA's fancy neighborhoods and beaches. </p>
      <p><b>Vehicles:</b> Car customization has been taken to a whole new level, you could literally spend hours creating the perfect car. Cars are not the only thing in GTA 5 that goes fast. The game has boats, trains, helicopters, all sorts of off road vehicles and reintroduces planes to the franchise. </p>
      <p>Planes were removed from GTA 4 for a variety of reason, but they are back and better than before. During the main missions there are not that many opportunities to fly, but as you save money you can purchase (or steal) stunt planes, fighter planes, corporate jets or just a small aircraft for casual flying. Helicopters are similar to GTA 4 but with some larger cargo copters as well as a great attack helicopter known as the Buzzard. </p>
      <p><b>Financial:</b>  A major problem with the game is the money, or the lack of it. The properties are way too expensive and don't pay enough weekly income to make them worth buying. At the end of the game, you will not have an opportunity to make significant amounts of money again. Meaning you need to pick your purchases wisely. Also, you won't be able to afford the coolest stuff until the end of the game, which is ok since you're bound to be roaming San Andreas for weeks after finishing the story, but it would be nice to have these things during the campaign. There is a work around to this problem involving waiting until after you make most your money in a big mission, then coordinating a set of assassination missions with the stock market to make lots of extra money. But if you did not do this, you'll have very little money to spend for the rest of the game. </p>
      <p><b>Music:</b> The music in GTA 5 is much better than GTA 4 in my opinion. There is pop music, classic rock, classic west coast rap, indie music and much more. 8th gen console and PC players get several new songs that 7th gen did not. The songs on the radio will occasionally mirror what is going on in the game which I like a lot. The game also has about an hours' worth of original score that plays during important missions and while the players are talking. </p>
      <p><b>Online:</b> Once you're done the campaign, why not hop online? Grand Theft Auto Online lets you play missions with your friends and other players across the world. You can also roam the game world with these players and spend your money earned in missions on cars and weapons for future missions. I've only just started playing this online mode and I can already tell I'm going to enjoy it and probably spend more hours than I should in the online world. </p>
      <p><b>Finally:</b> GTA 5 is one of the best Grand Theft Auto's in years. San Andreas looks amazing, the missions are fun and exciting. There could of been more money to be made in the campaign to play with more of the goodies during the game. But if money is short you can always go have plenty of fun in the online mode. </p>
