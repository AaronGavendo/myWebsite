      <h1>Game Boy Advance SP (NES Classic Design) Review</h1>
      <img class="right" src="../Pictures/Games/GBA-NES-3.jpg" alt="GBA pic" style="width:310px;height:310px;">
      <p><b>November 25th 2015</b></p>
      <p>The Game Boy Advance SP with the NES Classic Design is just about the most stylish Game Boy you could own. The console is designed to look like a NES controller when flipped open and a NES console when closed. Either way it is the coolest Game Boy on the market (unless you're a huge Pikachu fan). This article is less of a review and more of a letter to the reader of how cool I am for owning one of these. </p>
      <p><b>Hardware: </b>If you're looking to buy one Game Boy I would recommend the Advance SP for several reasons. The Advance SP folds to protect the screen and can easily be stored or placed in your pocket. There is no longer a need to change batteries as the console has a built in battery that can be charged via a charging cord. This solves one of the biggest problems that previous Game Boys had which was using up too many AA batteries which could be costly. The screen is backlit and that feature can be turned off if needed to conserve power. The console is backwards compatible with Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, which is why I recommend this model for all your games. You can switch between full screen and original format by using the L and R buttons. </p>
      <p>The only problems I have with the console is that there is no audio jack. If you are using the console out in public you can't really listen to music without an adaptor which is a hassle. Also, when you place Game Boy/Game Boy Color cartridges into the system they stick out the front a little. This can make storing in your pocket a little awkward and maybe even make it a little awkward to hold. </p>
      <p><b>Style: </b>This Game Boy Advance SP looks really cool and sleek. The top is light grey with a NES pattern and the bottom is dark grey. When open the gamepad is in the classic NES style with all the buttons labeled like the original NES controller. The NES style feels like a sticker but it is on the system very firmly and has a hard plastic texture to it. The system is very nostalgic to anyone who owned a NES as a kid or is a fan of retro gaming. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion: </b>This unit can be a little expensive these days. If you can find one for $100 CAN then I would recommend picking it up. It is well worth it for a Nintendo fan and is more than just a piece of nostalgia as it can play a wide variety of game and is the best platform to play them on. </p>
