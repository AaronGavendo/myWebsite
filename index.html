    <h2>New Game</h2>
    <h3>Lunar: The Silver Star</h3>
    <p class="left">June 10th 2015</p>
    <p class="left"> Picked this game up from Iceman Video Games in Kensington Market. I was first drawn to this game due to its similar look to the Phantasy Star series. The mechanics seem to be similar to the early Final Fantasy games, but unlike those early 8-bit and 16-bit games, this 1992 JRPG has cut scenes, real voices and CD quality music audio. How did an early 90's game achieve this? By being on the Sega CD of course! I have a huge backlog of games to play, but hopefully I'll get a chance to bust out the Sega CD soon and give it a try. In the mean time it will have to sit up on the shelf with Sonic CD and another thrift store Sega CD sports game to which I can't remember the name.<p>
